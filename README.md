# Robot of Things (RoT)
## Description
Code and documentation for my personal experimental robot.

The robot is based on a remote control car base and mostely uses parts I already had (things).

**Note:**
This is not a complete solution. You will also need at least the following packages and many features either won't work or have issues:

Package Name | Github source | Reference
------------ | ------------- | ---------
AWS RoboMaker TTS | https://github.com/aws-robotics/tts-ros1 | AWS RoboMaker (https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/)
Ackermann message | https://github.com/ros-drivers/ackermann_msgs | ROS Ackermann Group (http://wiki.ros.org/Ackermann%20Group)

## Overview
This robot is a personal projct to test robotics, deap learning and vision processing systems. I've shared the code here to help others in their learning of robotics and so others can give me feedback.

The robot is based on ROS (http://ros.org) the Robot Operating System. It uses many other people code either as packages or as modified source. I strive to credit the original authors where possible but sometimes miss one. If you notice any code not attributed to it's authore please let me know.

While making this robot I have used many online sites fo information. In no particuular order I have extensively used the following:

**ROS** - http://www.ros.org/
**pyimagesearch** - https://www.pyimagesearch.com
**O'Reilly Safafi Books Online (subscription)** - https://my.safaribooksonline.com/
**OpenCV** - https://opencv.org/

### RoTVision
The RoTVision board processes the stereo images from the cameras. It consists of a Raspberry Pi Compute Module CM3b+ (16Gb) with stereo cameras. I used a USB hub with an ethernet connection to connect it to the Odroid XU4.  

The board is loaded with Raspbian Stretch and I've compiled ROS Melodic (headless) and OpenCV 4.0.1. ROS includes the sensor_msgs and cv_bridge modules to communicate with ROS.

ROS on the board supplies the components required and it connects back to eth master. My .bashrc scripts contain the following to allow this:

    export ROS_HOST=rot
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://rot:11311

The IP address for the main controller (rot) is in the hosts file.

You'll also need to source the ROS setup script

source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

### Connecting the network between the boards (RoT and RoTVision)

The two boards need to talk to each other and the RoT Vision board needs to talk to the internet for updates etc through the RoT board or if its connected to my home network automatically switch to that for internet access.

I've implemented the robot network by having the RoTVision board default to the home network using DHCP. If it can't find that it drops back to a static IP that's connected to the RoT controller board (the normal mode of operation).

####The Router####
The RoT controller (Odroid XU4) is the network router for the robot. I've implemented the ethernet connections as follows:
    
    Eth0 is the external network gateway (USB Ethernet connection)
    Eth1 is the internal network (Onboard Network onnection)

The Odroid needs to have the following rules added to theÂ iptables:

	sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT

Then add the route on the Odroid
    
    sudo ip route add 10.1.0.0/24 via 10.1.0.2 dev eth1

Add the host names to the Odroids host file:

    sudo nano /etc/hosts

Add:

    127.0.1.1	rot
    10.1.0.2	rotvision


####RoTVision IP Configuration####
On the RoTVision board (Raspberry Pi Compute) with Raspbian Stretch installed Eth0 is the network interface to route through and we'll make it's IP Address 10.1.0.2. The Odroid is 10.1.0.1.

Open the configuration file:
    
    sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

Add the following to allow the device to use DHCP or fallback to a static IP.

	# It is possible to fall back to a static IP if DHCP fails:
	# define static profile
	profile static_eth0
	static ip_address=10.1.0.2/24
	static routers=10.1.0.1
	static domain_name_servers=10.1.0.1
	
	# fallback to static profile on eth0
	interface eth0
	fallback static_eth0
	
Add the host names to the Odroids host file:

    sudo nano /etc/hosts

Add:

    127.0.1.1	rotvision
    10.1.0.1	rot

**Note**
You may need to manually add a static default gateway route.

    sudo route add default gw 10.1.0.1

####RoTVision Stereo Camera Configuration####
The stereo cameras on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module has a special configuration to get the camera to work together detailed on the Raspberry Pi site:
